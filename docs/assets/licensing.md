Proprietary SVG Assets
======================

All SVGs and derived vector parts located under:

- `frontend/src/assets/crow_trace.svg`
- `frontend/src/assets/parts/`

are proprietary assets created internally. They were traced from internally
created artwork (see the Potrace comment at the top of each file) and are not
subject to external Creative Commons licensing. Redistribution or reuse outside
this repository is not permitted without explicit written permission.

Animation code, styles, and behaviors (including newly added walking
animations) are built on top of these proprietary vector assets and do not
confer any license on the underlying art.
